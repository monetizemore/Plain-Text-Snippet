# Plain-Text-Snippet
Plain Text Snippet is a block of HTML code what can be reused and preview plain text as it written in general. It can be used to post in blog like blogger or where HTML supports.
You can change background color,border color and configure it easily. Have a look on code it says all :D
index.html is used for the demo. You can use the plain-text-snippet.html for easy to understand :)
